This file is dedicated to Super Herozzz of Coding "Code With Harry" for providing
valuable Python tutorials and helping me complete my Python learning journey
from basics to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and beyond.

I have successfully learned all chapters up to Chapter 11:
1. Basics of Python
2. Strings & Lists
3. Conditional Statements & Loops
4. Functions & Recursion
5. File Handling
6. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
7. Inheritance & Operator Overloading

Throughout my learning, I made regular commits and pushed my progress to GitHub.
Now, I am ready to start my AI Chatbot Mega Project, thanks to the solid foundation
built with Code With Harry tutorials.

Thank you, Code With Harry!
